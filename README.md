Hi, Matthew here! I'm currently working on improving my coding hard skill. I'm currently enrolled in a tech bootcamp. I'm naturally good at time managing, planning, and adaptability to change.
I'm looking to collaborate with students of code and potential employers.
I'm looking for help with career opportunites and pathways.
Ask me about why I want to code.
How to reach me: matthewmunozxd@gmail.com
Pronouns: He/Him
Fun fact:  I like to volunteer for Austin city events and my church. I love building personal and professional connections.
